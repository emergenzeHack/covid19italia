Thanks for asking! We are glad to introduce ourselves. In this kind of projects, behind the scenes, there are many volunteers. People with a body, skills, passions and will to use part of their time (sometimes quite a lot!) and their abilities to do something useful.

Covid19.help experience, in particular, partly originates in a similar project following infos, initiatives, news related to the Central Italy earthquake of 2016.

You can have a look here : [https://terremotocentroitalia.info/](https://terremotocentroitalia.info/)

As occurred for terremotocentroitalia, Covid19.help is suppored by ActionAid Italy through the activities of its staff, activists and partners on projects all over the Italian territory.

Usually – and this is the case as well – later other people with different skills and experiences join the activities. The Team takes advantage of the past experience (for instance : the code/regulations, procedures, methodology for project development and communication) and develops new ideas. The result is what you can actually see : the activity of a collective intelligence, that could be named also civic hacking.

The names of people working on this project can be found here : [https://www.covid19italia.info/about/](https://www.covid19italia.info/about/) (the page is regularly updated)

**Great! Can you provide more details on the civic hacking method and approach?**

Sure. There is an issue related to the community. Some people of the community start looking for, suggesting and offering solutions in a voluntary and open approach. This is achieved using the opportunities offered by Internet. This is, shortly, the civic hacking. It’s collective intelligence at work. In an emergency, for instance, the main problem is being overwhelmed by information and it is no easy how to find or to report them. Covid19Italia.help is a potential solution to this issue.

The approach that we are using in this kind of project is called AGOPENDI : Aggregate, OPEN, Distribute :


    - Aggregate the contents. Contents are not necessarily structures and come from different sources (social media, mails, contact, ec.). The platform aggregates them through a manual work and structure them in order to have a standard model and get effective and usable data.


    - OPEN data. All details received are public and accessible with open licences. As we have to aggregate, structure the infos, giving access to data leads to further develop the service. There is an added value in it.


    - Distribute the infos. Oeìpen data can easily be transformed in new useful information. How? Through a service. Which one ? Use your fantasy and look for tools that could be easily be shared. For instance, Covid19Italia.help has a site, a Twitter profile, a Facebook page, a Facebook group, Instagram, a Telegram channel. From these sources everyone can share the reports.

All of his can be reused in the future and improved.
